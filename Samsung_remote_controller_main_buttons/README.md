I am using Arduino NANO
  
  For this project you need:
  
    1. Arduino (from size point of view I prefer NANO but other types can be good
    
    2. 10pcs of push-buttons
    
    3. 10pcs of 1K or 10K Ohm resistors
    
    4. IR LED
    
    5  50 Ohm resistor
    
    6. 20+ jumper wires

Right now I am ready with the breadboard version and I will make the normal PCB version too shortly.
